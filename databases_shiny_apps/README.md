## How to Connect your Access Database to R

### Create a MS Access Driver Specific for your Access DB
1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**  
  (You may need to search for **Control Panel** in the Windows Start Menu)
2. In the **Control Panel**, click **Administrative Tools**
3. In the **Administrative Tools** windows select **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** unless you want to make a 32-bit driver. This will be dependant on which version (32-bit or 64-bit) you are running of Access.

8. Click **OK** in the **Select Database** window then **OK** in the **ODBC Microsoft Access Setup** window

9. You should now see your newly created database driver in the list of available  User Data Sources

### Install and load packages in R
- `library(ODBC)`
    - This is the library that will establish a connection between your
- `library(DBI)`
    - Once connected with the database this library will allow you to put things out of the database

### Connect to the database, Run your analysis, and Close the connection

```R
connection <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "My_Database")
odbc_result <- DBI::dbReadTable(connection, "Fish_Abundance")
as_tibble(odbc_result)` #You can now use  the result as a typical tibble
odbcCloseAll()`   #When you are finished be sure to sever the connection to the database
```
